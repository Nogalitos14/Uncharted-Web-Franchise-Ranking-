  <h1>Why Uncharted Drake's Fortune is placed least on the list</h1>
  <h>
    <p>Uncharted Drake's Fortune introduces most of the main cast from the Uncharted franchise and shows how Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher met while she makes a documentry for Drake on finding the coffin of Sir Francis Drake, Nathan Drake's "ancestor". Instead he finds a map to the lost city of gold aka El Dorado. The reason why this game is placed furthest from the list is simply because of how dated it is. The gameplay feels less alive in this one compared to the others and the storyline isn't as captivating as the others either. Although the game is a little dated it is still a great achivement for being a solid standpoint for the uncharted franchise.</p>
