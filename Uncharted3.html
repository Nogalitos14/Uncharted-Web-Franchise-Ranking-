  <h1>Why Uncharted Drake's Deception is placed third in the list</h1>
  <p>Uncharted 3 is set 2 years after Among Theives has Nathan Drake and his mentor/bestfriend sully search for the lost city of Iram of the Pillars while being targeted by mercenaries, it also shows how Nathan and Sully met and why Nathan uses Drake as his last name. Uncharted Drake's Deception has a good story and great gameplay but it still falls short becuase of those same reasons, The gameplay is slightly less exciting as it's predecessor and the story is not as good, it makes up for it though with likeable characters and iconic scenes that make you feel like you're watching a blockbuster movie (plane scene for one). </p>
